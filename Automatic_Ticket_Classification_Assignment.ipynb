chase is that during the entire year from till present my statements have not reflected any late payments or any missed payments i learned that my loan was not paid for months back in and that i was being reported by chase mortgage on the transaction reports that i was late days for months how is it possible that my credit does not report this yet now that i am trying to purchase some income property it is being reported by chase that i am late and therefore i am being refused a loan for my investment what rights do i have as a consumer to be notified when my loan is overdue or missed on payments every statement i received did not reflect this i am very upset this has affected my ability to move forward financially and that chase is providing derogatory information that should not be

being reported by chase mortgage on the transaction reports that i was late days for months how is it possible that my credit does not report this yet now that i am trying to purchase some income
